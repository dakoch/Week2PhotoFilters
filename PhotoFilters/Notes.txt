// W2.D1.01[x] Setup your interface with the Nav Controller(ViewController.swift), the photo button at the bottom,
//                  and an image view that takes up most of the screen. Use autolayout in code
//                  to properly layout your interface
// W2.D1.02[x] Add an alert controller with the style set to action sheet
// W2.D1.03[x] Add a gallery action that pushes a gallery view controller onto the nav
//                  controller
// W2.D1.04[x] In the gallery view controller, display at least 6 photos in your gallery
//                  (https://unsplash.com is great)

//
// W2.D2.01[x] Setup your custom protocol & delegate, which will allow your gallery view
//                  controller to communicate back to the home view controller which
//                  image was selected from the gallery
// W2.D2.02[x] Setup a collection view to show filtered thumbnails of the image
// W2.D2.03[ ] Setup your collection view's bottom constraint to start the collection
//                  view off screen, and then animate it up when the user clicks
//                  the filter option in the action sheet
// W2.D2.04[ ] Following my (insane) workflow for applying filters to the thumbnails.
//                  Don't worry if you don't get it 100%, we will spend a lot of
//                  time tomorrow going over it and refining it. Good luck

//
// W2.D3.01[ ] Setup your Share and Done buttons for your home view controller's navigation item
// W2.D3.02[ ] Add a UIimagePickerController to allow the user to take images from their device's
//                  camera. Only show this option if the camera exists on the device
// W2.D3.03[ ] Add a third view controller for photos pulled from the Photos framework. Use the
//                  same protocol & delegate methods from the galleryVC
// W2.D3.04[ ] Use the SLCompViewController to post a photo up to twitter #ellensburg
// W2.D3.05[ ] When entering filter mode, shrink the main image view down by adding to its
//                  constraints constant values. Make this animated (of course)
// W2.D3.06[ ] Figure out some way to apply the selected filter from the filter thumbnail
//                  collection view to the image in the main image view
// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

//
// W2.D4.01[ ] Get caught up with everything from the prior assignments
// W2.D4.02[ ] Add the pinch gesture recognizer to your gallery view controller, and change
//                  the item size when the pinching takes place
// W2.D4.03[ ] Add a 2nd language to your app and correctly translate your user facing strings
// W2.D4.04[ ] Using the assets catalogue, add 2x and 3x version of your gallery images to your app
// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
//  Friendship Friday, January 16, 2015
//
// W2.D5.01[ ] Extra challenge: Properly orientate the photos that are picked from the
//                  Photos Framework View Controller
// W2.D5.02[ ] Another one: Setup another camera view controller with AVFoundation
//                  instead of UIImagePickerController
